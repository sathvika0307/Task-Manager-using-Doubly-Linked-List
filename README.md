# 📋 Task Manager using Doubly Linked List

A **Command-Line Task Manager** built using **Python** and a **custom Doubly Linked List**. This project showcases the application of **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** in building a practical, interactive tool. Perfect for students looking to demonstrate their DSA skills on resumes or during interviews.

---

## 📝 Project Description

This CLI-based Task Manager allows users to manage their to-do items using the underlying structure of a **Doubly Linked List**. Tasks include a title, priority, and completion status, with functionality to add, remove, mark, and view tasks.

---

## ✨ Features

- ➕ Add task at the **beginning** or **end**
- 🗑️ Delete a task by **title**
- ✅ Mark task as **completed**
- 🔍 Search and display all tasks
- 🏷️ Maintain **priority** for each task (High/Medium/Low)
- 📦 Simple, clean terminal interface

---

## 🛠 Technologies and Concepts Used

- **Python 3.6+**
- **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**
- **Modular Programming**
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**

---

## 📚 DSA Concepts Applied

- ✅ Doubly Linked List (insert, delete, traverse)
- ✅ Node creation and memory linking
- ✅ Task search and modification
- ✅ Data encapsulation and class-based implementation
- 🚀 Potential for Merge Sort or Insertion Sort (as a future enhancement)

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Code Editor (e.g., VS Code)
- Basic understanding of Python and Linked Lists
